## Figuring out
- Large files: my data CSVs are 350-500MB each and I haven't bothered to put a real solution in place
- 2016 County name vs jurisdiction
- Do I even need jurisdiction column?
- Straight-ticket vote results
- Write-in votes
- Still need to rigorously look for "weird" rows and decide what to do with them
- Find an authoritative final count per state to compare my "cleaned" totals to
- Add the exploratory code that let me find those interesting rows
- Look for any counties / jurisdictions present in one year but not the other
- Name inconsistencies: "donald trump" vs "donald j trump"
- County names; someone insists on saying "so-and-so county"

## Modules Needed
- zipfile -- seems to already be installed
