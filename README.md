## Figuring out
- Large files: my data CSVs are 350-500MB each and I haven't bothered to put a real solution in place
- 2016 County name vs jurisdiction
- Straight-ticket vote results
- Write-in votes
- Still need to rigorously look for "weird" rows and decide what to do with them
- Find an authoritative final count per state to compare my "cleaned" totals to
- Add the exploratory code that let me find those interesting rows

## Modules Needed
- zipfile -- seems to already be installed
-
